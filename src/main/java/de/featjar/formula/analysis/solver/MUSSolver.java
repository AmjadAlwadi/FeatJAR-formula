 * A solver that extracts a minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS) from a formula.
 * A minimal unsatisfiable subset is any unsatisfiable subset of a formula that cannot be reduced any
 * further without becoming satisfiable, thus explaining why the formula is unsatisfiable.
 * This extraction is only possible when the given formula is not satisfiable.
